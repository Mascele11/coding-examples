## Overview
This repository is a reference implementation of the project backbone I use across my work.

It provides a consistent structure for:
- directories and modules
- packaging
- setup and tooling commonly used in ML development

Many of my production projects are under NDA (especially those involving MLOps frameworks), so this repo focuses on the reusable foundations rather than proprietary implementations.
